      <p> My name is Jose and I'm one of those elusive Denver natives. I don't mean that in an elitist way, it just amuses a lot of people to meet one of us these days. Not quite yet a unicorn, but on our way; a local novelty. I live in Denver with my girlfriend, Megan and two dogs, Bukowski and Toki.</p>
      <p>I've played bass guitar for over half of my life now. Currently not in an active band, but I'm on the lookout for something new. In addition to that, like most nerds I enjoy board games and video games.</p>
